**🦠 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker**
A data analysis project exploring global COVID-19 trends — focusing on confirmed cases, deaths, and vaccination progress in Kenya, the United States, and India — using Python tools and real-world data.

📌 Project Overview

This project investigates the progression of COVID-19 across multiple countries over time. Using the Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset, it focuses on comparative analysis, time trends, and key public health metrics like case counts, death rates, and vaccination coverage.

Built in a Jupyter Notebook, the project combines data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and insightful visualizations to reveal patterns and disparities in the global pandemic response.

**🎯 Objectives**

Load and clean real COVID-19 global data

Analyze confirmed cases and deaths over time

Visualize country-level vaccination progress

Compare outcomes between Kenya, the U.S., and India

Summarize key observations with visual evidence

**📊 Tools & Technologies**

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Data visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook (for analysis + storytelling)

Dataset: Our World in Data — owid-covid-data.csv

**📌 Key Results & Insights**

🇺🇸 United States had the fastest and most expansive vaccine rollout, reaching nearly 60% full vaccination by the end of 2021.

🇮🇳 India experienced a major death surge mid-2021, corresponding with the Delta variant wave, despite lower cumulative deaths than the U.S.

🇰🇪 Kenya showed a significantly slower vaccination uptake (under 10% by end of 2021) and a flatter death curve overall, likely due to supply constraints and younger population demographics.

🧮 Death rate calculations (total_deaths / total_cases) revealed differences in public health impact, highlighting the importance of early interventions.

🌍 Vaccine access and response strategies varied greatly between high-income and low-income countries, as reflected in the visual data.
